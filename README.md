# DESCRIPTION:
# 🎙️ Speech Recognition System (Speech-to-Text using Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Speech Recognition System developed using Python that converts spoken audio into readable text. The system leverages pre-trained speech recognition models via the SpeechRecognition library and Google Web Speech API to transcribe short audio clips accurately.
The project demonstrates practical implementation of Artificial Intelligence concepts in real-world voice processing systems and showcases how pre-trained models can be integrated into Python applications.
This system is capable of:

Processing audio files

Converting speech to text

Handling errors gracefully

Supporting clean audio preprocessing

Generating accurate transcription results

## 🎯 Objective of the Task

The objective of this task was to:

Build a basic Speech-to-Text system
Use pre-trained speech recognition models
Process short audio clips
Generate accurate textual transcription
Demonstrate real-world AI application

This project was developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence Internship assignment.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

### 💻 Programming Language
Python 3.11

### 📚 Libraries Used
SpeechRecognition – for speech-to-text conversion
pydub – for audio format conversion
FFmpeg – for audio processing backend

### 🌐 API Used
Google Web Speech API (Pre-trained speech model)

### 🧰 Development Environment
VS Code / Command Prompt
Windows OS

### 🧠 How the System Works

The system accepts an audio file (WAV format preferred).
If audio is recorded via mobile (m4a/mp3), it is converted into:

PCM WAV format

16kHz sample rate

Mono channel

The processed audio is loaded using SpeechRecognition.
The recognizer sends audio data to the pre-trained Google model.
The model returns transcribed text.
The system prints the recognized text to the console.
This workflow ensures compatibility, accuracy, and stability.

### 🌍 Real-World Applications

This system can be applied in:
Voice assistants
Automated transcription services
Accessibility tools for visually impaired users
Meeting recording systems
Customer support automation
AI chatbot voice input systems
Subtitle generation tools

### 🧩 Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following concepts were implemented:

Speech signal processing basics

Audio preprocessing

Working with pre-trained AI models

API integration

Error handling in Python

Real-world AI system pipeline design

### ⭐ Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical implementation of Artificial Intelligence concepts in speech processing systems. It highlights how pre-trained deep learning models can be integrated into lightweight Python applications for real-world use cases.
